    "introduction": "In eighth grade, the student will evaluate, analyze, develop, and produce media messages that are intended for specific audiences. The student will create multimodal presentations that include different points-of-view, and collaborate with others to exchange ideas, make decisions, and solve problems. The student will continue the study of word origins, roots, connotations, and denotations. There is a continued emphasis on reading comprehension by comparing literary and informational texts. In literary texts, the student will analyze the development of theme(s) and compare/contrast authors’ styles. There will be an increased emphasis on informational reading, and the student will analyze authors’ qualifications, point of view, and style. Reading and writing will continue to be an integrated process wherein the student will use authors and texts read as models when working on techniques in their own writing; the student will continue to develop as both reader and writer. The student will also plan, draft, revise, and edit writing in a variety of forms with an emphasis on expository and persuasive writing. The student will write persuasively and use claims, evidence, and counterclaims to advocate and support a position to fit the audience and purpose. The student will be expected to have greater control over the conventions of writing. When researching, the eighth-grade student will apply research techniques to analyze information gathered from diverse sources by identifying misconceptions and possible bias. They will evaluate the validity and credibility of sources, and will apply research techniques to quote, summarize, and paraphrase findings. In addition, the student will learn to cite sources using the Modern Language Association (MLA) or American Psychological Association (APA) style sheet and follow ethical and legal guidelines for gathering and using information. These skills are necessary for success in future postsecondary education and workplace environments.",
