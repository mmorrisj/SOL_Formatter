  "introduction": "The following standards outline the content of a one-year course in Data Science. If a one-semester course is desired, the standards with a dagger (†) would apply. The Data Science Standards of Learning provide an introduction to the learning principles associated with analyzing big data. Through the use of open-source technology tools, students will identify and explore problems that involve the use of relational database concepts and data-intensive computing to find solutions and make generalizations. Students will engage in a data science problemsolving structure to interact with large data sets as a means to formulate problems, collect and clean data, visualize data, model using data, and communicate effectively about data formulated solutions.",
