    "introduction": "The following standards outline the content of a one-year course in Probability and Statistics. If a one-semester course is desired, the standards with a dagger (†) would apply. The purpose of the course is to present basic concepts and techniques for collecting and analyzing data, drawing conclusions, and making predictions. Technology tools will be used to assist in teaching and learning. Graphing technologies facilitate visualizing, analyzing, and understanding algebraic and statistical behaviors and provide a powerful tool for solving and verifying solutions.",
