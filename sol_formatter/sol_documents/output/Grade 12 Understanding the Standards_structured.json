    "introduction": "In twelfth grade, there is a sustained emphasis on reading comprehension by comparing, analyzing, and evaluating literary and informational texts. The student will examine and analyze literary texts by British authors evaluating how authors use key elements to contribute to meaning and interpreting how themes are connected across texts. The student will continue development of vocabulary, with attention to connotations, idioms, classical allusions, and figurative language. With an explicit focus to integrate reading and writing processes, the grade-twelve student will use mentor texts as models to analyze and evaluate informational text and use the writing process to write with an emphasis on technical writing for multiple purposes and audiences to create focused, organized, and coherent writing. The student will write to a standard acceptable to both the workplace and to postsecondary education. The student will explain and analyze how media influences beliefs, interpretations, and behaviors. The student will create interactive multimodal presentations both independently and in collaborative groups. The student will produce a research product synthesizing information from primary and secondary sources while maintaining ethical and legal guidelines for gathering and using information. The student will continue to demonstrate the ability to work within diverse teams and collaborative groups.",
