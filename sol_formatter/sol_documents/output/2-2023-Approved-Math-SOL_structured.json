    "introduction": "The Grade 2 Standards extend the study of number and spatial sense to include three-digit whole numbers and solid geometric figures. Students will demonstrate fluency and recall with automaticity addition and subtraction facts within 20. Students will also solve single-step and multistep problems, including those in context, involving addition or subtraction of whole numbers where addends or minuends do not exceed 100. Students will begin to use U.S. Customary units to measure length, weight, and liquid volume to the nearest whole unit. Students will engage with the data cycle using pictographs and bar graphs. The data cycle includes formulating questions to be explored with data; collecting or acquiring data; organizing and representing data; and analyzing data and communicating results. The use of appropriate technology and the interpretation of the results from applying technology tools must be an integral part of teaching, learning, and assessment. While learning mathematics, students will be actively engaged, using concrete materials and appropriate technologies to facilitate problem solving. However, facility in the use of technology shall not be regarded as a substitute for a student’s understanding of quantitative and algebraic concepts or for proficiency in basic computations. The acquisition of specialized mathematical vocabulary and language is crucial to a student’s understanding and appreciation of the subject and fosters confidence in mathematics communication and problem solving. Problem-solving is integrated throughout the content strands. The development of problem-solving skills is a major goal of the mathematics program at every grade level. The development of skills and problem-solving strategies must be integrated early and continuously into each student’s mathematics education.",
