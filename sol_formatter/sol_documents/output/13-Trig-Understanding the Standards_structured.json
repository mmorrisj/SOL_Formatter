    "introduction": "The standards below outline the content for a one-semester course in Trigonometry. Trigonometry includes the study of trigonometric definitions, applications, graphing, and solving trigonometric equations and inequalities. Emphasis should also be placed on using connections between right triangle ratios, trigonometric functions, and circular functions. In addition, the application of trigonometric concepts should be included throughout the course of study. Oral and written communication concerning the language of mathematics, logic of procedure, and interpretation of results should also permeate the course. Technology tools will be used to assist in teaching and learning. Graphing technologies facilitate visualizing, analyzing, and understanding algebraic and statistical behaviors and provide a powerful tool for solving and verifying solutions.",
