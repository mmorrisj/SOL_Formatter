  "introduction": "Developing foundational literacy skills is a priority in first grade. These skills include phonological and phonemic awareness, print awareness, phonics, fluency, language usage and handwriting. A student in first grade will learn and apply more complex phonics patterns when reading and writing while increasing their automaticity in reading words and connected text. The student will gain fluency when reading and rereading both phonetically controlled and uncontrolled texts. While foundational skills are a focus, it is equally important that the student continue to build world and word knowledge. Immersing the student in a text and language rich environment supports the student’s development of communication skills, vocabulary, comprehension, and an appreciation for reading and writing. The first-grade student will apply comprehension strategies when reading and listening to literary and informational texts and collaborating in classroom discussions. To support knowledge building, an emphasis will be given on materials connected to mathematics, science, and history and social science. The first-grade student will write in a variety of forms for specific purposes.",
