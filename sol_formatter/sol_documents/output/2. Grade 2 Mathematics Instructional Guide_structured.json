    "grade_level": "2",
    "course_name": "Mathematics",
    "year": 2023,
    "introduction": "The Mathematics Instructional Guide, a companion document to the 2023 Mathematics Standards of Learning, amplifies the Standards of Learning by defining the core knowledge and skills in practice, supporting teachers and their instruction, and serving to transition classroom instruction from the 2016 Mathematics Standards of Learning to the newly adopted 2023 Mathematics Standards of Learning. Instructional supports are accessible in #GoOpenVA and support the decisions local school divisions must make concerning local curriculum development and how best to help students meet the goals of the standards. The local curriculum should include a variety of information sources, readings, learning experiences, and forms of assessment selected at the local level to create a rigorous instructional program. For a complete list of the changes by standard, the 2023 Virginia Mathematics Standards of Learning â€“ Overview of Revisions is available and delineates in greater specificity the changes for each grade level and course. The Instructional Guide is divided into three sections: Understanding the Standard, Skills in Practice, and Concepts and Connections aligned to the Standard. The purpose of each is explained below."
