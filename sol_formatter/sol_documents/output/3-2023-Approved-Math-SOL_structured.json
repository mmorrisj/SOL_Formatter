    "introduction": "The Grade 3 Standards place emphasis on developing an understanding of the concepts of multiplication and division. Students will recall with automaticity multiplication facts through 10 × 10 and the corresponding division facts and will use this knowledge to solve contextual problems with multiplication and division. Students will extend knowledge of place value to six-digit whole numbers. Concrete models and pictorial representations will be used to deepen understanding of fraction concepts, including comparing, composing, and decomposing. Students will use standard units (U.S. Customary and metric) to measure length, weight/mass, and liquid volume. Students will be introduced to solving contextual problems involving elapsed time. Properties of shapes will be explored, and students will identify polygons, combine and subdivide polygons, and name the resulting polygon(s). Students will engage with the data cycle using pictographs and bar graphs. The data cycle includes formulating questions to be explored with data; collecting or acquiring data; organizing and representing data; and analyzing data and communicating results. Students will work with a variety of growing patterns using various representations. The use of appropriate technology and the interpretation of the results from applying technology tools must be an integral part of teaching, learning, and assessment. While learning mathematics, students will be actively engaged, using concrete materials and appropriate technologies to facilitate problem solving. However, facility in the use of technology shall not be regarded as a substitute for a student’s understanding of quantitative and algebraic concepts or for proficiency in basic computations. The acquisition of specialized mathematical vocabulary and language is crucial to a student’s understanding and appreciation of the subject and fosters confidence in mathematics communication and problem solving. Problem-solving is integrated throughout the content strands. The development of problem-solving skills is a major goal of the mathematics program at every grade level. The development of skills and problem-solving strategies must be integrated early and continuously into each student’s mathematics education."
