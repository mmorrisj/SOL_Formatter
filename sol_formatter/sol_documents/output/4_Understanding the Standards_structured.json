    "introduction": "In fourth grade, there is an increased emphasis on reading comprehension by comparing literary and informational texts. The student will apply comprehension strategies to monitor their understanding and to think critically about the grade level texts read. Collaborative conversations and writing about reading continue as an extension to expand students’ understanding of what they read. The student will read a variety of genres with a focus on realistic and historical fiction across cultures. The student will expand vocabulary using knowledge of roots, affixes, synonyms, antonyms, and homophones. The fourth-grade student continues to write in a variety of forms and purposes across content. Student writing in fourth grade gets more complex, and the student will use organizational structures to convey their message through writing. Working in diverse teams as both a facilitator and a contributor, the student will continue to increase communication and collaboration skills. The student will deliver multimodal presentations and begin to examine media messages. The student will demonstrate comprehension of the research process by evaluating the relevance and reliability of information collected to create a research product. Additionally, the student will continue to understand the difference between plagiarism and using their own words.",
