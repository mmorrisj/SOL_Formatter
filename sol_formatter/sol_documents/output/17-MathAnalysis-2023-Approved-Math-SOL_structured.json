    "introduction": "Students enrolled in Mathematical Analysis are assumed to have mastered Geometry and Algebra 2 concepts. Mathematical Analysis develops students’ understanding of algebraic and transcendental functions, parametric and polar equations, sequences and series, and vectors. The content of this course serves as appropriate preparation for a calculus course. Technology tools will be used to assist in teaching and learning. Graphing technologies facilitate visualizing, analyzing, and understanding algebraic and statistical behaviors and provide a powerful tool for solving and verifying solutions.",
