    "introduction": "In tenth grade, the student will continue to build upon skills learned in earlier grades. There is a sustained emphasis on reading comprehension by comparing and analyzing literary and informational texts. The student will analyze the historical, cultural, and social function and universal themes of literary texts from different cultures. The tenth-grade student will analyze and synthesize information from informational texts to solve problems, answer questions, and generate new knowledge. The student will continue development of vocabulary, with attention to connotations, idioms, classical allusions, and figurative language. With an explicit focus to integrate reading and writing processes, the grade-ten student will use mentor texts as models to write with an emphasis on argument while showing relationships among claims, reasons, and evidence from reliable sources. The student will create media messages and continue to use multimodal tools to create presentations both independently and in small groups, reflecting on their own role in the process. The student will analyze and evaluate how media messages are created by reviewing both print and digital publications. The student will continue to build research skills presenting information gathered from diverse sources, identifying misconceptions and possible bias while crediting sources using MLA or APA style. The tenth-grade student will continue to become a skilled communicator, working both independently and in collaborative groups while presenting alternate views and working to fulfill a specific purpose.",
