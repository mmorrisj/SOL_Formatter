    "introduction": "At the sixth-grade level, the student will demonstrate the ability to work with diverse teams working respectfully with others, participating both as a facilitator and contributor. There is a continued emphasis on text reading and fluency as the student begins to read and comprehend more complex literary and informational texts. In sixth grade, the student will take a deeper look at plot development and be able to explain how an author’s style impacts the reader’s interpretation of a text. There is an increased emphasis on informational reading by creating objective summaries and drawing inferences using textual evidence. These critical-thinking skills are foundational to technical reading and writing and are transferable across content areas. At the sixth-grade level, the student will continue to develop as both reader and writer. The student will also plan, draft, revise, and edit writing in a variety of forms to include multi-paragraph compositions with an emphasis on the development of elaboration and unity. Additionally, the student will be introduced to writing thesis statements. The student will be expected to have greater control over the conventions of writing. In addition, the student will evaluate the validity and authenticity of texts, and will research, organize, evaluate, and communicate information. The student will also learn to cite both primary and secondary sources and follow ethical and legal guidelines for gathering and using information. These skills are necessary for success in future postsecondary education and workplace environments.",
