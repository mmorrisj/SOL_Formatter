    "introduction": "The Grade 1 Standards place emphasis on counting, representing, comparing, and ordering sets of objects up to 120; recognizing, describing, and transferring repeating and growing patterns; and analyzing and sorting plane figures. Students’ understanding of number is expanded through recognizing and describing part-part-whole relationships for numbers up to 10, recalling addition and subtraction facts to 10 with automaticity, as well as solving problems using addition and subtraction within 20. Students will begin the study of fractions by solving problems that involve partitioning models into two and four equal-sized parts. Students will use nonstandard units to measure and compare objects by length, weight, and volume. Students will engage with the data cycle using object graphs, picture graphs, and tables. The data cycle includes formulating questions to be explored with data; collecting or acquiring data; organizing and representing data; and analyzing data and communicating results. The use of appropriate technology and the interpretation of the results from applying technology tools must be an integral part of teaching, learning, and assessment. While learning mathematics, students will be actively engaged, using concrete materials and appropriate technologies to facilitate problem solving. However, facility in the use of technology shall not be regarded as a substitute for a student’s understanding of quantitative and algebraic concepts or for proficiency in basic computations. The acquisition of specialized mathematical vocabulary and language is crucial to a student’s understanding and appreciation of the subject and fosters confidence in mathematics communication and problem solving. Problem-solving is integrated throughout the content strands. The development of problem-solving skills is a major goal of the mathematics program at every grade level. The development of skills and problem-solving strategies must be integrated early and continuously into each student’s mathematics education.",
