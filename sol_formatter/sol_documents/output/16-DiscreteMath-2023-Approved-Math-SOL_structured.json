  "introduction": "The following standards outline the content of a one-year course in Discrete Mathematics. If a one-semester course is desired, the standards with a dagger (†) would apply. Discrete Mathematics may be described as the study of mathematical properties of sets and systems that have a countable (discrete) number of elements. With the advent of modern technology, discrete (discontinuous) models have become as important as continuous models. In this course, the main focus is problem solving in a discrete setting. Techniques that are not considered in the current traditional courses of algebra, geometry, and calculus will be utilized. As students solve problems, they will analyze and determine whether a solution exists (existence problems), investigate how many solutions exist (counting problems), and focus on finding the best solution (optimization problems). Connections will be made to other disciplines. The importance of discrete mathematics has been influenced by technology. Technology tools will be used to assist in teaching and learning. Graphing technologies facilitate visualizing, analyzing, and understanding algebraic and statistical behaviors and provide a powerful tool for solving and verifying solutions.",
