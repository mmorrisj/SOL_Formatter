    "introduction": "The Grade 8 Standards continue to build on the concepts needed for success in high school level Algebra, Geometry, and Statistics. Students will explore real numbers and the subsets of the real number system. Proportional reasoning is expounded upon as students solve a variety of problems. Students find the volume and surface area of more complex three-dimensional figures and apply transformations to geometric shapes in the coordinate plane. Students will verify and apply the Pythagorean Theorem creating a foundation for further study of triangular relationships in Geometry. Students will represent data, both univariate and bivariate, and continue to apply the data cycle and extend the application to boxplots and scatterplots. Students build upon the algebraic concepts developed in the Grade 6 and 7 Standards, which include simplifying algebraic expressions, solving multistep linear equations and inequalities in one variable, and graphing linear functions. The Grade 8 Standards are vital to providing a solid foundation in Algebra 1. The building of mathematical knowledge can be enhanced by using technology tools when used strategically and to complement further learning during grades 6-8. The use of appropriate technology and the interpretation of the results from applying technology tools must be an integral part of teaching, learning, and assessment. However, facility in the use of technology shall not be regarded as a substitute for a student’s understanding of quantitative and algebraic concepts or for proficiency in basic computations. Students must learn to use a variety of methods and tools to compute, including paper and pencil, mental arithmetic, estimation, and the use of instructional technology. Graphing utilities, spreadsheets, calculators, dynamic applications, and other technological tools support mathematical problem solving, reasoning, and justification, as well as application in science, engineering, business and industry, government, and practical affairs. In grades 6-8, the acquisition of specialized mathematical vocabulary and language builds as students continue to deepen their understanding of mathematics through communication and problem solving. Problem solving increases in complexity as students progress into middle and high school. Students continue to build upon their mathematical knowledge by participating in problem-solving activities that promote higher levels of critical thinking and analysis.",
