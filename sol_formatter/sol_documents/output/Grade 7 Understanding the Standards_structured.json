    "introduction": "At the seventh-grade level, the student will continue to deliver multimodal presentations individually and in collaborative groups. The student will also interpret information presented in diverse media formats and share responsibility for collaborative work, as both a contributor and a facilitator, while striving for consensus to accomplish goals. The student will continue the study of word origins and roots and begin to distinguish among connotations of words. There is a continued emphasis on text reading and fluency as students continue to read and comprehend complex literary and informational texts. In literary texts, the student will analyze point of view, interpret the author’s style, and compare and contrast texts on similar topics. When reading informational texts, the seventh-grade student will analyze how authors use evidence, facts, and opinions to support points in multiple texts. Reading and writing will continue to be an integrated process wherein the student will use authors and texts read as models when working on techniques in their own writing. The student will continue to write for a variety of audience and purposes, focusing on the development of a clear central idea, tone, and voice. In persuasive writing, the student will be able to clearly state claims using evidence from a text or personal experience as support. The seventh-grade student will be expected to have greater control over the conventions of writing. In research, the student will find, evaluate, and select appropriate resources for an oral, visual, written, or multimodal research product. They will evaluate the validity and authenticity of sources, and will apply research techniques to quote, summarize, and paraphrase findings. These skills are necessary for success in future postsecondary education and workplace environments.",
