    "introduction": "In fifth grade, there is an emphasis on reading comprehension by comparing grade level literary and informational texts. The student will continue to read a variety of literary and informational texts focusing on the author’s craft, style, and approach on a topic or concept. Collaborative conversations and writing about their reading continue as an extension to expand the student’s understanding of what they read. The student will continue to expand vocabulary using knowledge of roots, affixes, synonyms, antonyms, and homophones. The student will use the writing process to write in a variety of forms and purposes across content, demonstrating their thinking and understanding about a text. The student will collaborate with diverse teams working respectfully with others, showing engagement, and valuing individual contributions. The students will deliver multimodal presentations and compare/contrast a variety of techniques used in media messages. The student will demonstrate comprehension of the research process by evaluating the relevance, reliability, and credibility of information collected to create a research product.",
