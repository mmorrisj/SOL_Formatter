  "introduction": "The successful mastery of Algebra 1 is widely considered to be the gatekeeper to success in the study of upper-level mathematics. The study of algebraic thinking begins in kindergarten and is progressively formalized prior to the study of the algebraic content found in the Algebra 1 Standards of Learning. The progression of algebraic content includes patterning, generalization of arithmetic concepts, proportional reasoning, and representing mathematical relationships using tables, symbols, and graphs. All students are expected to achieve proficiency with the Algebra 1 Standards. The study of Algebra 1 assists students in generalizing patterns and representing relevant, contextual situations with algebraic models. To assist students in developing meaning and connecting algebraic concepts to geometry and statistics, consideration should be given to the sequential development of concepts and skills by using concrete materials to support the transition from the numeric to the symbolic. Connections between Algebra 1 and other subject areas through contextual applications may help students attach meaning to the abstract concepts of algebra. These Standards require students to use algebra as a tool for representing and solving a variety of contextual problems. Tables and graphs will be used to interpret algebraic expressions, equations, and inequalities and to analyze behaviors of functions. These Standards include a transformational approach to graphing functions and writing equations when given the graph of the equation. Transformational graphing builds a strong connection between algebraic and graphic representations of functions. Technology tools will be used to assist in teaching and learning. Graphing technologies facilitate visualizing, analyzing, and understanding algebraic and statistical behaviors and provide a powerful tool for solving problems, verifying solutions, and making connections.",
