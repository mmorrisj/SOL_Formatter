    "introduction": "The Grade 6 Standards provide a transition from the emphasis placed on whole number arithmetic in the elementary grades to an introduction to algebraic thinking. The Standards include a focus on single-step and multistep problems involving operations with integers and positive rational numbers. Students will determine equivalency, compare, and order decimals, fractions, and percents. Students will solve problems involving area and perimeter and begin to graph in a coordinate plane. In addition, students will continue using the data cycle by applying it to circle graphs and develop concepts regarding measures of center. Students will solve linear equations in one variable, write inequality statements, and use algebraic terminology. Students will use ratios to compare two quantities and represent proportional relationships as a precursor to the development of the concept of linear functions. The building of mathematical knowledge can be enhanced by using technology tools when used strategically and to complement further learning during grades 6-8. The use of appropriate technology and the interpretation of the results from applying technology tools must be an integral part of teaching, learning, and assessment. However, facility in the use of technology shall not be regarded as a substitute for a student’s understanding of quantitative and algebraic concepts or for proficiency in basic computations. Students must learn to use a variety of methods and tools to compute, including paper and pencil, mental arithmetic, estimation, and the use of instructional technology. Graphing utilities, spreadsheets, calculators, dynamic applications, and other technological tools support mathematical problem solving, reasoning, and justification, as well as application in science, engineering, business and industry, government, and practical affairs. In grades 6-8, the acquisition of specialized mathematical vocabulary and language builds as students continue to deepen their understanding of mathematics through communication and problem solving. Problem solving increases in complexity as students progress into middle and high school. Students continue to build upon their mathematical knowledge by participating in problem-solving activities that promote higher levels of critical thinking and analysis.",
