  "introduction": "This course is intended to provide students with experiences in using computer programming techniques and skills to solve problems involving mathematical models. Students enrolled in Computer Mathematics are assumed to have studied the concepts and skills in Algebra 1 and beginning Geometry. Even though computer ideas should be introduced in the context of mathematical concepts, problem solving should be developed in the most general sense, allowing the techniques to be applied by students in many other environments. Strategies include defining the problem; developing, refining, and implementing a plan; and testing and revising the solution. Programming, ranging from simple programs involving only a few lines to complex programs involving subprograms, should permeate the entire course. Programming concepts, problem-solving strategies, and mathematical applications should be integrated throughout the course. These standards identify fundamental principles and concepts in the field of computer science that will be used within the context of mathematical problem solving in a variety of applications. As students develop and refine skills in logic, organization, and precise expression, they will apply those skills to enhance learning in all disciplines.",
