    "introduction": "Geometry is a course designed for students who have successfully completed the Standards for Algebra 1. The course includes an emphasis on developing reasoning skills through the exploration of geometric relationships including properties of geometric figures, trigonometric relationships, and mathematical proofs. In this course, students use various types of reasoning, justification, and methods of direct and indirect proof and interpret and determine the validity of conditional statements. Venn diagrams are used to represent set relationships. This set of standards includes emphasis on two- and three-dimensional reasoning skills, coordinate and transformational geometry, and the use of geometric models to solve problems. A variety of applications and some general problem-solving techniques, including algebraic skills, should be used to implement these Standards. Technology tools and dynamic geometry applications will be used to assist in teaching and learning. Graphing technologies facilitate visualizing, analyzing, and understanding algebraic behaviors and geometric patterns and provide a powerful tool for visualizing and verifying solutions.",
