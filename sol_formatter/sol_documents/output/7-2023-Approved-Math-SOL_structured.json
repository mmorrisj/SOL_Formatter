    "introduction": "The Grade 7 Standards continue to emphasize the foundations of Algebra. The Standards address the representation and comparison of rational numbers using exponents, scientific notation, and square roots. Students continue to develop proficiency in operations with rational numbers and solving problems in context by expanding their study from Grade 6. Students will build on the concept of ratios to solve problems involving proportional reasoning, which is emphasized throughout the Grade 7 Standards. Students will solve problems involving volume and surface area and focus on the relationships among the properties of quadrilaterals. In addition, students will continue to apply the data cycle and extend the application to histograms. Probability is investigated through comparing experimental results to theoretical expectations. Students continue to develop their understanding of solving linear equations and inequalities in one variable by applying the properties of real numbers. Students investigate proportional relationships and begin to develop a concept of slope as rate of change. The building of mathematical knowledge can be enhanced by using technology tools when used strategically and to complement further learning during grades 6-8. The use of appropriate technology and the interpretation of the results from applying technology tools must be an integral part of teaching, learning, and assessment. However, facility in the use of technology shall not be regarded as a substitute for a studentâ€™s understanding of quantitative and algebraic concepts or for proficiency in basic computations. Students must learn to use a variety of methods and tools to compute, including paper and pencil, mental arithmetic, estimation, and the use of instructional technology. Graphing utilities, spreadsheets, calculators, dynamic applications, and other technological tools support mathematical problem solving, reasoning, and justification, as well as application in science, engineering, business and industry, government, and practical affairs. In grades 6-8, the acquisition of specialized mathematical vocabulary and language builds as students continue to deepen their understanding of mathematics through communication and problem solving. Problem solving increases in complexity as students progress into middle and high school. Students continue to build upon their mathematical knowledge by participating in problem-solving activities that promote higher levels of critical thinking and analysis.",
