    "introduction": "In eleventh grade, there is a sustained emphasis on reading comprehension by analyzing, evaluating, and critiquing literary and informational texts. The student will conduct comparative analyses of multiple texts that address the same topic to determine how authors reach similar or different conclusions. The student will examine and analyze literary texts by American authors describing the contributions of other cultures and identifying prevalent themes and characterizations, which are reflective of American history and culture. The student will continue development of vocabulary, with attention to connotations, idioms, classical allusions, and figurative language. With an explicit focus to integrate reading and writing processes, the grade-eleven student will use mentor texts as models to write with an emphasis on analysis for multiple purposes and audiences to create focused, organized, and coherent writing. The student will also have authentic opportunities to write for postsecondary experiences, including college and the workplace. The student will create and deliver multimodal presentations and analyze and critique how media messages are constructed for specific audiences. The student will produce a research product synthesizing information from primary and secondary sources while maintaining ethical and legal guidelines for gathering and using information. The eleventh-grade student will continue to build communication skills working both independently and in collaborative groups. The student will continue to demonstrate the ability to work within collaborative groups while presenting alternate views and working to fulfill a specific purpose.",
