  "introduction": "The Grade 5 Standards place emphasis on solving problems, including those in context, with whole numbers, fractions, and decimals. Students will develop an understanding of prime and composite numbers, determine the prime factorization of a whole number up to 100, and solve problems using order of operations. Students will also solve problems involving area, perimeter, and volume. Students will determine the probability of an outcome by constructing a model of a sample space and using the Fundamental (Basic) Counting Principle. Students will engage with the data cycle using line plots and stem-and-leaf plots. The data cycle includes formulating questions to be explored with data; collecting or acquiring data; organizing and representing data; and analyzing data and communicating results. Students will be introduced to expressions with a variable to support the development of the algebraic concepts necessary for success in the middle grades. The use of appropriate technology and the interpretation of the results from applying technology tools must be an integral part of teaching, learning, and assessment. While learning mathematics, students will be actively engaged, using concrete materials and appropriate technologies to facilitate problem solving. However, facility in the use of technology shall not be regarded as a substitute for a student’s understanding of quantitative and algebraic concepts or for proficiency in basic computations. The acquisition of specialized mathematical vocabulary and language is crucial to a student’s understanding and appreciation of the subject and fosters confidence in mathematics communication and problem solving. Problem-solving is integrated throughout the content strands. The development of problem-solving skills is a major goal of the mathematics program at every grade level. The development of skills and problem-solving strategies must be integrated early and continuously into each student’s mathematics education.",
