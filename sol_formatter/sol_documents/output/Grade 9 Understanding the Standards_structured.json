    "introduction": "In ninth grade, the student will continue to build upon skills previously learned in earlier grades with a variety of texts. There is a continued emphasis on reading comprehension by explaining, comparing, and analyzing literary and informational texts. In literary texts, the student will apply knowledge of literary terms to describe, differentiate, and analyze a variety of genres. In ninth grade, there will be an increased emphasis on informational reading, and the student will examine the function of a text within context. The student will demonstrate their comprehension by writing and use the texts read in class to understand the author’s craft to compose original compositions. The student will continue to expand vocabulary using the structural analysis of roots and affixes, as well as figurative language, to understand complex words. With an explicit focus to integrate reading and writing processes, the grade-nine student will use mentor texts as models to plan, draft, revise, and edit expository writing in preparation for postsecondary work and career. There is also an emphasis on persuasion, defending a position using counterclaims, reasons, and evidence from credible sources. The student will continue to work in collaborative groups assisting with setting guidelines and working toward consensus. The student will evaluate sources and examine media messages to analyze the content, author’s viewpoint, and structure. The student will select, use, and analyze multimodal tools to create presentations both independently and in small groups. The student will apply research techniques to create independent research products and analyze and synthesize information gathered from diverse sources by identifying misconceptions and possible bias, citing both quoted and paraphrased information using either MLA or APA style.",
