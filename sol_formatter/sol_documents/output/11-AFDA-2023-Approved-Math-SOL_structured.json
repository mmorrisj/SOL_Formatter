    "introduction": "Algebra, Functions, and Data Analysis is a course designed for students who have successfully completed the Standards for Algebra 1 and may benefit from additional support in their transition to Algebra 2. Within the context of mathematical modeling and data analysis, students will study functions and their behaviors, systems of inequalities, probability, experimental design and implementation, and analysis of data. Data will be generated through practical applications arising from science, business, and finance. Students will solve problems that require the formulation of linear, quadratic, exponential, or piecewise-defined equations or a system of equations. Through the investigation of mathematical models and interpretation/analysis of data from relevant, applied contexts and situations, students will strengthen conceptual understandings in mathematics and further develop connections between algebra and statistics. Students should use the language and symbols of mathematics in representations and communication, both orally and in writing, throughout the course. These Standards include a transformational approach to graphing functions and writing equations when given the graph of the equation. Transformational graphing builds a strong connection between algebraic and graphic representations of functions. Technology tools will be used to assist in teaching and learning. Graphing technologies facilitate visualizing, analyzing, and understanding algebraic and statistical behaviors and provide a powerful tool for solving and verifying solutions.",
